                <h2>Lake Malawi and the Orange Dam</h2>
                <p> Once the site of a large hydroelectric infrastructure project,
                the settlement of "Orange Dam" was originally the site of employ
                for a few hundred Boers from South Africa. The local government
                listened to the appeals that the diversity hires were screwing things
                up, since the Malawi Africans didn't like the rough and arrogant
                Shona from the South, and so, with the government's blessing,
                Orange Dam was declared a white-only state. The idea was to put
                whites into a ghetto of just their own, a concept that pleased the
                communist-influenced leader of Malawi. However, whites make great
                things when we band together in solidarity with one another.
                Orange Dam was finished efficiently, and a town sprung up around
                the infrastructure project. Rather than becoming a ghost town, it
                became a place of refuge for the Rhodesians, who were being
                slaughtered by the hundreds on their farms. The same fate would
                later befall the South Africans, as the end of apartheid and
                increasingly corrupt measures by the government sanctioned
                racially-directed violence at the white minority in Africa.
                The Orange Dam became a place where they could escape persecution,
                where the people's soverignty was recognized, and eventually, where
                a new nation was recognized. Instead of making apartheid within
                existing states, a new state was made for White Afrikanners to
                call home. Rhodesians and Boers alike kept alive aspects of their
                own cultures, but they ultimately bonded over their work ethic
                and united as Afrikaaners. It's a story not so different from how
                the protestant work ethic propped up the early American states. I
                don't think they have a very positive view of your average modern
                American though... </p>
                <p>Most westerners are ignorant of African politics anyway. 
                The establishment hucksters thought they could just sweep this
                little breadcrumb trail under the rug too.</p>
